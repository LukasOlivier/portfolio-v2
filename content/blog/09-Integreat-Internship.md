## Introduction

I was introduced to [Integreat](https://www.integreat.be/) at the Internship Fair in Kortrijk on September 14, 2023. The discussion about their projects and company values immediately captured my interest, making it my top choice for an internship.

Starting in February 2024, I embarked on a 13-week internship with Integreat, an IT service provider based in Waregem, Flanders. Integreat specializes in assisting educational institutions, professional associations, and local governments in optimizing their procurement, sales, and financial processes through tailored software solutions and IT services.

Unlike most other companies, Integreat operates out of a converted villa, lending it a uniquely cozy atmosphere. During our midday breaks, I played darts with my colleagues, adding a competitive touch to our routine.

One of the most exciting perks of working at Integreat was the meeting room, located on the top floor. It wasn't your typical corporate space; instead, it secretly housed a PlayStation,complete with a VR headset. But of course, this room was primarily used for meetings and brainstorming sessions.

## Project Overview

My main task during the internship was developing the Integreat Dashboard. This tool aims to enhance client services by providing customizable dashboards that help clients visualize and analyze data, thereby improving decision-making and business performance.

### Technologies Used

**[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)**: Leveraged for its Single Page Application (SPA) capabilities and component-based architecture.

**[DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/)**: Used for its rich UI components and tools.

**[SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)**: Managed data integration seamlessly through DevExpress Data Model Wizard.


### Key Features
- Customizable Dashboards: Users can select and arrange widgets and place them on the dashboard.
- Multi-Language Support: Supports French, Dutch, and English.
- Data Export: Charts and data exportable to Excel or PDF.
- User Preferences: Customizable colors, charts.
- Data Filtering: Filters data based on selected companies and periods.

## Conclusion

The Integreat Dashboard successfully met its goals, providing a customizable and user-friendly experience. The integration of Blazor and DevExpress ensured modularity and maintainability. This project significantly enhanced my skills in Blazor, SQL Server, and DevExpress, while also improving my communication skills through demos and defending project decisions.
