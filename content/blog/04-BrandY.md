## BrandY 2.0: Transformative Week, Inspiring Insights, Global Connections! 🚀🎮

In my fifth semester, I got the opportunity of a lifetime: participating in the BrandY project with my talented team members [Bilal Ben Mohammadi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bilal-ben-mohammadi/), [Quiandro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quiandro-steenbeke-6896b8294/), and [Lucas Guillemyn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-guillemyn-280103g/). Together, we were determined to create an amazing update for the BrandY game.🚀🎮

The project week connected us with international students and teachers who use the game. It wasn't just any week but an adventurous journey filled with wonderfull activities. From exploring the [Historium museum](https://www.historium.be/nl/ontdek-historium) to tasting craft brews during a visit to a local brewery [Bourbogne des Flandres](https://www.bourgognedesflandres.be/). The icing on the cake was the 'taste your country' evening on Monday, where the diversity of flavors and traditions truly connected us with the world.🌍🍻

What made this week truly special was the direct interaction with users. We listened to their feedback, asked about their experiences, and gathered valuable insights for the long-awaited 2.0 update. Additionally, we had the honor to share our progress with the teachers, who, with their expertise, shaped our work further.🤝📈

A sincere thanks to the entire BrandY team for this unforgettable experience. 🙏🌟
