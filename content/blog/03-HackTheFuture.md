I had the privilege of being a guest at HackTheFuture in Antwerp, an event organized by [Cronos Group](https://cronos-groep.be/) that took our passion for technology to new heights. üöÄ The day commenced with a car journey from Izegem due to an NMBS strike, marking the start of a remarkable day.

### Arrival and Challenges

Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed, not only with a hearty breakfast üç≥ but also with an informative session about what lay ahead. Throughout the day, we had the opportunity to delve deep into our project, with the highlight being the SAP challenge presented by [Flexso](https://www.flexso.com/en). With intense focus and effort, we achieved an honorable second place in the competition, a result we are proud of.

### Exploring Antwerp Zoo and the Award Ceremony

During the lunch break, we took some time to explore the Antwerp Zoo ü¶ì, an unexpected but welcome break from the technological challenges. The evening brought the award ceremony üèÜ, where we not only received valuable feedback from the jury but also recognition for our achievements.
Victory unfortunately slipped through our grasp, and we finished in second place. We would like to thank Flexso for their valuable support during this challenge.

After the formal ceremonies, we concluded the day with informal conversations and a well-deserved glass ü•Ç. It was a great opportunity to connect with fellow participants and organizers, sharing experiences.

### Reflections and Gratitude

In retrospect, HackTheFuture was more than a competition; it was a journey of learning, growing, and sharing passions. My sincere thanks to Flexso for their support and to the organizers for creating an event that was both challenging and inspiring. Here's to new technological adventures! üåê

Sincere appreciation for the organizers who managed to put together such a fantastic event, where creativity and learning were dynamically encouraged.
