# Introduction to INCASO


Welcome to our blog about our international project in Rijeka during the carnival week! Last month, we had the opportunity to participate in an exciting project in this beautiful city on the Adriatic Sea, together with a group of students from different parts of Europe. Throughout the entire week, we worked together on a project that brought us in contact with the local community and immersed us in the rich culture and traditions of Rijeka, especially during the carnival period.

Rijeka is a port city located in western Croatia, known for its vibrant and diverse cultural scene. The city has a long history of maritime trade and cultural exchange, which is reflected in its architecture, cuisine, and festivals. One of the most famous and beloved festivals in Rijeka is the carnival, which takes place every year in February. During the carnival, the city transforms into a colourful and lively stage for parades, concerts, and other cultural events.

Our project aimed to develop innovative and sustainable solutions to make the beach in Rijeka a more attractive and popular destination for tourists and locals alike. We recognized that the beach had a lot of potential as a natural and cultural asset of the city, but also faced some challenges in terms of infrastructure, amenities, and promotion. We also engaged with the local community through workshops, discussions, and other interactive activities to foster intercultural dialogue and understanding.

As a participant in this project, we had the opportunity to learn and grow in many ways. Not only did we gain a deeper appreciation for the cultural diversity and richness of Rijeka and Croatia, but we also developed our skills in teamwork, communication, and cross-cultural collaboration. We met many wonderful people from different countries and backgrounds, and this experience has broadened our horizons and enriched our perspective on the world.

In this blog, we will share our experiences and insights from this project and our time in Rijeka during the carnival week. We hope to give you a glimpse into the exciting and rewarding world of international projects and cultural exchange and to inspire you to explore new horizons and connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds.

### Sunday - Arrival

Sunday was the day we began our exciting international project in Rijeka, Croatia. We started early in the morning, leaving our homes in Belgium and heading to Zaventem airport. We were eager and excited to embark on this adventure together.

After a smooth flight, we landed in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. As we stepped out of the airport, we were immediately struck by the beautiful surroundings and the warm and sunny weather (but still there was a lot of snow there as well). We decided to make the most of our layover and explore the city center, which was just a short bus ride away.

Ljubljana was truly a gem of a city, with its charming old town, picturesque bridges, and lively street scenes. We strolled around the narrow alleys and squares, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. We also stopped at a local bar and tried the famous Union beer, which was refreshing and delicious.

After a few hours of sightseeing and relaxation, we headed to the bus station to catch our Flixbus to Rijeka. The journey was comfortable and scenic, passing through the beautiful countryside of Slovenia and Croatia. We were already somewhat tired and decided to take it easy on the bus and enjoy the silence.

Finally, around 9 pm, we arrived at our hostel in Rijeka. We were greeted by our friendly and welcoming roommate, who happened to be from South Korea. We introduced ourselves and chatted for a while, learning about each other's backgrounds and interests. Despite the long day of travel, we felt energized and inspired by the prospect of what lay ahead.

After an hour of conversation, we decided to call it a night and get some rest for the first day of the project. We drifted off to sleep, excited and curious about what we would discover and achieve in the days to come.

### Monday - Introducing Rijeka

Monday was the first day of our international project in Rijeka, Croatia, and we were eager to get started. We woke up early in the morning and had breakfast before setting out to explore the city. Around 10 am we took a bus to the city center, where we were immediately struck by the festive atmosphere of Carnaval.

After a couple of hours of wandering around the city, we stopped at a bar for a midday break. To our surprise, they had Stella Artois, which was a welcome taste of home for us Belgians. We enjoyed a beer and a light snack before continuing our exploration of the city.

Later in the afternoon, we headed to the school where the project was being held. We were warmly welcomed by Nikolina, who gave us a gift and our bus passes, and then took our seats in the classroom. We saw fellow Howest students arriving and we were happy to see that there were a good number of us. After the explanation and welcome, our first workshop began with Tatjana. She led the first workshop, which focused on social innovation, social entrepreneurship, and sustainable tourism. We were also given info about our project, team division and the assignment for our visit to Preluk (more info later).

After the workshop that ended around 8 pm, we decided to go to a typical Croatian restaurant for dinner. When we entered the restaurant, it smelled delicious and it also looked fantastic. It looked just like a typical German restaurant with one clear theme being meat. Tatjana joined us and helped us navigate the menu, which was full of delicious and exotic dishes we had never tasted before. We savored every bite and enjoyed the chance to unwind and chat about the day's events.

Overall, Monday was a great start to our project in Rijeka. We had the chance to explore the city, learn about social innovation and sustainable tourism, and enjoy some delicious Croatian cuisine. We were excited about what the rest of the project would bring.

### Tuesday - Starting the project

Tuesday was another early start for us as we had to meet at the PAR building at 9:45 am to head towards Preluk, a beach that had not been used for a long time. The purpose of our visit was to come up with ideas to make the beach more attractive to tourists.

When we arrived at Preluk, we took a 20-minute walk to explore the area and see what it looked like. The view was stunning, with clear blue waters and beautiful natural scenery. During the hike, we were also told which groups we were in, and we used this opportunity to exchange our ideas.

After the hike, we found a terrace and sat down to discuss our ideas over a refreshing beer. The sun was shining, and it was the perfect weather to be outside enjoying the beautiful scenery.

Around 12:30 pm, we returned to PAR and had lunch, which was provided by the school. The food was always delicious, and it was a great time to relax and chat with our fellow students.

After an hour-long lunch break, we had two classes in the afternoon. The first was on Cultural Heritage as a sustainable tourism product, and the second was a workshop on sustainable tourism - entrepreneurial journey.

The lessons ended a bit earlier that day, around 6 pm, and we were able to leave the school. Some of us went to a restaurant that was fully decorated for Valentine's Day, while others went to a pizzeria that had been recommended several times. Both groups had delicious meals and enjoyed spending time together.

After dinner, we met up and headed towards a bar that we quickly dubbed the "student bar." It wasn't actually called that, but it became our regular spot over the whole trip because of the cheap cocktails. We spent a long evening at the bar, chatting and enjoying the atmosphere.

Eventually, we decided it was time to head back to our hostel and get some rest for the next day. We took a taxi and arrived back at the hostel around 2 am. Overall, it was another fantastic day filled with exploration, learning, and good times with great people.

### Wednesday - Tourism in Rijeka 

On Wednesday morning, we gathered at the school building around 10 am to head towards the Children's House and the Sugar Refinery Palace. The Children’s House is a building dedicated to children located within the new Culture Block in Rijeka, Croatia. Designed as an entrance to the world of culture for children up to the age of 12, the Children's House is more than just a place for kids to learn. 

It's a place where they can be performers and producers, not just spectators. The building is organized as a box inserted within the original brick walls, with the existing walls reinforced with concrete and the new concrete box supported by steel beams and existing cast iron columns. The space between the two walls is used for staircases, which encircle the box in a clockwise direction. Each room has its own unique feel and use and is accessed from this architectural promenade. In the building, we saw a library, cinema, playroom and more…

Next, we visited the Sugar Refinery Palace, also known as the Benčić Palace. This palace was built as one of the facilities of Rijeka’s sugar refinery compound and marked the beginning of Rijeka’s industrial story. Today, it's a beautiful and historic building that offers a glimpse into the city's past. In the building, we learned a lot about how it all started for them and saw a lot of old tools that they used.

After our visit, we returned to the school building for lunch before continuing our afternoon classes. These classes covered topics such as City Culture as a Touristic Brand, Leadership for Moving Beyond Sustainability, and a workshop on SDG 2030, Customer Journey Concept, and Environmental Scanning.

Around 6 pm, the lecture day came to an end, and the group went for a drink before dinner. We split up into two groups, with some heading towards King's Caffe Food pub, a restaurant known for its burgers and other special types of fries, while the others went to the Irish Pub to watch the Champions League.

After both groups finished eating, we reunited at our regular pub to finish the day around 2-3 am. Overall, it was another fantastic day filled with new experiences and knowledge-sharing.

### Thursday - Guest speaker 

Thursday was our last day of the trip, and we had a lot to do. We had to gather at 10am and had three hours to work on our project. Although we were grateful for the extra time, we knew there was still a lot to be done, and we wanted to make the most of it.

After three hours, we took a lunch break and then had some workshops and lessons. The first lesson was about heritage interpretation, which was quite interesting. However, it lasted only a short time because we had another workshop to attend, and this one was all about psychology.

In this workshop, we were divided into groups of four and given a deck of cards to play a game. Each table had its sheet of instructions, and after we learned and read the rules, two players swapped with another group to join them there.

We were supposed to play the game according to the rules, but it was clear that not everyone was on board. Some of us didn't want to adapt to the new rules, which led to some frustration and confusion.

Despite this, the game was a good way to learn about how people react and adapt in different situations. We learned that not everyone is willing to adapt, even when it is necessary. It was a valuable lesson that we'll take with us long after the trip has ended.

After a 15-minute break, we had another hour to work on our project. By 6pm, we had finished our work and decided to head out for dinner. We all agreed to go to a Chinese restaurant to try their sushi. We ordered sushi, and we were pleasantly surprised when a beautiful wooden boat arrived, filled with freshly prepared sushi.

We tasted all sorts of things, and it all tasted very good. It was a great way to end our trip, enjoying some delicious food together. After dinner, we headed to our regular café and spent the rest of the evening there.

Our group was a bit larger than usual, as we were joined by some of our fellow Belgians and Koreans.

### Friday - Presentations 

Friday was a day full of anticipation and excitement. It was the day that we have been working towards all week, the day where we had to present our projects to the judges. The energy was high and there was a sense of nervousness in the air.

We gathered at 10 am, ready to put the finishing touches on our projects. There was a flurry of activity as we worked diligently to ensure that everything was perfect. The morning flew by, and before we knew it, it was time for the mock presentations.

Each group had to do a practice presentation in front of all the other groups. It was nerve-wracking to be presenting in front of our peers, but it was useful to get some initial feedback and to see what the other groups had been working on. It was inspiring to see so many cool ideas and interesting projects.

After the mock presentations, it was time for the real thing. The judges were present, and we had to present our projects to them. They were very engaged and asked some challenging questions, which made us think on our feet. It was clear that they had done their homework and were well-informed about what we were presenting.

After everyone had finished presenting, we gathered in the classroom to hear the results. The judges announced the winners, and we were thrilled to hear that they were impressed with our ideas. It was a proud moment for us, knowing that all our hard work had paid off.

After the announcement, we split up to grab some lunch. Some of us went to the pizzeria where one group had been earlier in the week. The food was delicious, and we had a great time hanging out with each other.

As the night drew on, a group of us decided to explore some of the more seedy neighborhoods of the city. It was an adventure, and we had a lot of fun exploring the backstreets and hidden alleyways. Eventually, we ended up back at the Youth Club, where we spent the rest of the night reminiscing about the week and the experiences we had shared.

### Saturday - Trip to Učka

Saturday was a day full of excitement and adventure as we embarked on a trip to the Poklon Visitor Centre situated on the beautiful Učka mountain.

Even though our project was over, we were all still hyped about this new top destination for all future visitors to the Učka Nature Park.

The aim of the center is to make visitors aware of the importance of nature and the need for its active protection through education and multimedia experiences.

As soon as we reached the visitor center, we were greeted by the stunning view of the natural surroundings, and we were all eager to explore. The centerpiece of the center was the multimedia exhibition which presented, in a modern and interactive way, the natural, cultural, and historical values of the Učka Nature Park and the surrounding area, emphasizing the need for its protection and preservation. We were all impressed by the content of the exhibition, which was divided into thematic units: In the Mountain, Home, Fascination, Inspiration and From the Top of Učka. We were able to learn so much about the natural beauty of the park and the need to protect it.

Although we spent a total of 2 hours on the bus to get to the Učka mountain, it didn't matter to us as we were all in high spirits. To keep the bus lively, we sang popular Flemish songs such as "Dos cervezas" or "Vis in de Leie". It was a fun and memorable experience for all of us.

After the excursion, we all headed back to our accommodations to start packing for our return flight. We knew that Sunday would be a busy day, so we had to make sure everything was in order.

For dinner that evening, we decided to go to a fancy restaurant called Bistro Mornar that served special and tasty meals. Some of us decided to try shark, others opted for black risotto and some even tried monkfish. It was a unique experience tasting these dishes and sharing our experiences with one another.

After dinner, we all headed towards the Youth Club once again to enjoy the night together one last time. We had a great time and talked the night away until closing time. It was a bittersweet moment as we knew that the next day would be our last day in Croatia, and we would have to say goodbye to all the friends we had made during this trip. However, we were all excited about the upcoming Rijeka International Carnival Parade, which was going to be a highlight of our trip.

### Sunday - The Carnival

Sunday marked the final day of our Croatian adventure, and it was undoubtedly the highlight of our trip. The day was dedicated to Carnival, a holiday of great significance in Rijeka. We were all eagerly waiting for this day to come and were nervous about our costumes for a whole week. As we gathered at 11 am, everyone was in their elaborate and well-thought-out costumes, ready to participate in the lively parade.

Our theme was based on the popular TV series, The Addams Family. The ladies in our group were dressed as Morticia Addams, and the men were all sporting tight-fitting suits like Gomez. One person was dressed up as Cousin Itt. The costumes of all the groups were just impressive, but the floats were even more breathtaking. The carnival in Rijeka was twice as busy and fanatical as we had expected, comparable to the famous Aalst Carnival in Belgium.

As we started walking, the crowd around us was already growing, and we were all excited and nervous. We had five stops where we had to dance next to a cheering crowd, and we had no idea that this was part of the tradition, so we didn’t prepare anything. Our first dance was a bit awkward as we were still getting used to the rhythm and everyone did their thing, but eventually, everyone started to groove, and the experience became exhilarating. The entire parade route was filled with lively music and enthusiastic spectators, and we could hardly contain our excitement.

To our surprise, our dances were even broadcasted on National Croatian Television, which made the experience even more memorable. After an hour of walking among the people in the parade and occasionally taking photos with people, the parade was done for us. We were free to do what we wanted next, either watch the rest of the parade or join the festivities at the tent, and most of us chose the latter option.

After a whole afternoon of partying, we decided to get some food and end the night with a drink at another bar. We reminisced about the trip, and how fantastic it had been to participate in the Rijeka Carnival. The atmosphere, the music, and the crowd all contributed to making this a truly unforgettable experience.
