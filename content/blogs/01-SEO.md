# Guest Lecture SEO
Dive into the fascinating world of SEO with us! 💻 During our recent guest lecture, we thoroughly discussed who is responsible for optimizing a website: the developers or the marketing team? Opinions are divided, but let's set aside that debate for now. 🤔

When it comes to the time it takes to achieve that coveted top position on Google, patience is key. SEO is not a sprint but rather a marathon that can take several months. ⏳

Is Google still the king of searches, or are we turning more to platforms like TikTok and AI? The guest lecture revealed the different phases of SEO, from research to website construction. 🛠️

### Bol.com's Clever Use of Synonyms
And let's talk about an interesting phenomenon: the clever use of synonyms and context. Ever noticed how Bol.com subtly and ingeniously uses 'garden furniture' with various contexts in their product description? If you look closely, it seems like they randomly use different terms, but who reads the text under the title, right? They've placed it purely for SEO. 📚💡

### The Three Pillars of SEO
Various techniques play a crucial role in optimizing a website, from wireframes and mindmaps to readable URLs and smart keyword usage. 🔍

The three pillars of SEO – technology, content, and authority – were emphasized. And let's not forget the handy tools like SEO Finder, AI, and TikTok Keyword Insights. 🛠️🤖

The interplay between SEO and UX can be a challenge, but the guest lecture provided valuable insights and techniques to not only make your website more discoverable but also generate more traffic. 🚀
