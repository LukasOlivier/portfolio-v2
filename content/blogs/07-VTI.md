Embarking on an educational adventure, a team of Applied Computer Science students from [Howest Bruges](https://www.howest.be/nl) organized an engaging workshop for the 6th-grade students at [VTI in Izegem](https://www.izegem.be/adressen/prizma-campus-vti). This immersive session unfolded into two exciting segments: Flask API development and the art of Pentesting. Let's delve into the details of this captivating journey!

## Flask API: Crafting a Quote-sharing Hub with Python üåê

### The Objective:

The participants, guided by the Howest team, navigated to the pre-made front-end website, and witnessed the initial state of the API ‚Äì a blank canvas awaiting their creative coding.

### Adding Quotes and Creating Endpoints:

The workshop progressed with the creation of endpoints for the API. Under the expert guidance of the Howest team, students learned to fetch and display quotes, add new quotes, generate random quotes, clear the entire quote list, and even retrieve a specific quote based on its index.

## Pentesting Playground: Hacking Challenges Await üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Prosperity Trust Bank Challenge:
The afternoon session, led by the Howest team, unfolded with a fascinating exploration into the world of Pentesting. The students, under the mentorship of the Applied Computer Science students, were presented with a challenge ‚Äì hacking into the Prosperity Trust Bank's website.

### Robust Challenges:

The challenges included deciphering secrets hidden in robots.txt, exploring image metadata to find a birthdate, engaging in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) to log in as Bert and discover his secret, manipulating developer tools to alter an employee's salary, analyzing network requests to discover hidden flags, and a final challenge involving local storage and hashing to unveil admin privileges.

### Unraveling the Mysteries:

With guidance from the Howest team, the participants navigated through these challenges, utilizing a range of skills from code interpretation to ethical hacking practices. The challenges not only tested their technical prowess but also encouraged creative problem-solving.

## Wrapping Up: Empowering the Future Cyber Experts üë®‚Äçüíª

As the workshop concluded, it was evident that the students, under the mentorship of the Applied Computer Science students from Howest Bruges, had not only gained hands-on experience with Flask API development but had also delved into the intriguing world of Pentesting. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical challenges paved the way for a holistic learning experience.

## Special Thanks:

A heartfelt thank you to the Howest Bruges team and all the Applied Computer Science students who contributed to creating this enriching workshop. Additionally, gratitude to the lecturers at VTI Izegem for providing the opportunity to inspire and nurture the next generation of cyber experts.
