Combell: Premium Hosting - A Dive into the Technological Future

During a guest lecture organized by  [Alexander Vandepitte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-vandepitte/), [Simon Verdonck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonverdonck) opened the door to the intriguing world of Combell, a hosting pioneer going beyond conventional services. Let me take you on a journey through their technological landscape and discover why they deserve the title 'premium hosting.' üåê


Simon shared the fascinating story of how Combell originated and evolved into an indispensable player in the hosting industry. But what sets them apart from the rest? <ins>Technological Mastery</ins>.üí°

At the core of Combell's premium hosting is the intelligent distribution of computing power across multiple servers. If one server fails, another seamlessly takes over. But what makes this 'premium'? Here's where the technical magic comes into play.

The significant investments go into state-of-the-art data centers. Here, not only is there redundant data storage, but also power, with various sources and battery backups. Dual internet providers minimize downtime.‚öôÔ∏è

### Hosting of the Future

Combell aims for next-generation hosting. With Linux Debian, Apache web hosting, and individual containers with firewalls for customers, they offer more than just storage. SSH access and brute force protection elevate security to a higher level.

Combell's offering includes 'Managed WordPress,' a package that provides not only automatic updates but also a demo environment with a helpful AI assistant. Their marketing campaign, 'Go Big Online,' highlights how small businesses can use Combell as a growth partner.üìà

Fun fact: even the servers handling the ticket sales of Tomorrowland, one of the world's largest events, are located at Combell.

In a time where online presence is crucial, Combell seems to define the future of hosting with a combination of advanced technology, security, and a comprehensive approach.

Thank you for the insightful lecture, Simon Verdonck! üëè
